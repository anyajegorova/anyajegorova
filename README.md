## 🌍 From Estonia to Finland, Coding My Way to Full-Stack Mastery

Originally from Estonia, I've been calling Finland home for over a decade now. My mother tongue is Russian, but you'll also find me fluent in English and navigating my way through Finnish at a pretty solid level.

## 🎓 My Journey in Tech

🎓 I recently graduated from **Haaga-Helia UAS (Pasila Campus)** with a **GPA of 4.22**, earning my degree in **Business Information Technology**. But learning doesn’t stop at graduation—I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and skills, especially in web development.

## 💻 What I Do

🚀 Right now, my main focus is **Front-End Development**—I love crafting sleek, user-friendly, and responsive websites. But I don’t stop there! While my heart is in front-end, I also have experience with **Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB**, meaning I can build and deploy full-stack applications as well.

💡 Since the beginning of last year, I’ve been volunteering as a **Mobile Developer** at **Vesko**, a startup where I get to collaborate, build, and innovate.

## 🎯 Future Goals

🌱 My ultimate dream? To become a **Full-Stack Developer**, seamlessly bridging the gap between front-end magic and back-end logic. I’m always excited to learn new technologies and push my boundaries in software development.

## 🎸 Beyond the Code

🎵 When I'm not deep into coding, you'll probably find me strumming my guitar or sewing my next creative piece. Because, hey, creativity isn't just for coding, right? 😄
